EXTRA BUILD INSTRUCTIONS - READ

When building, you will need to configure lwjgl for the OS that you are building
on.  This is done by going to Project Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries >
Expand lwjgl > 'Native Library Folder Location' > change to folder in work 
space > choose appropriate foler (i.e. for Mac it is:
SeprDSA/lwjgl-2.9.0/native/macosx ).
